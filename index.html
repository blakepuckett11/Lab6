                <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it 
                    to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
                    sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker.

                <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking 
                    at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
                    as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop 
                    publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text.

            <div>
                <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
                <p>
                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
                    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
                    Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage.

            <div>
                <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some 
                    form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a 
                    passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
